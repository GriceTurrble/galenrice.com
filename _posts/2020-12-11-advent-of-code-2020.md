If you're following along with this blog so far, I commend your dedication, as clearly I am not one to post here often.

Like many others, I am participating in the ongoing [Advent of Code][advent_of_code_site] (and for posterity sake, [link to the 2020 calendar][advent_of_code_2020]). It's a fun diversion from work, side projects that have goals, home life, Covid scares, and the general malaise that is this year.

I've been keeping up with it like I do with any code I write, by posting stuff on GitHub. You can check out [the repo containing my solutions][my_advent_of_code_repo], all written as Python code within [Jupyter][jupyter_org] notebooks.

GitHub ends up rendering each notebook and running its code automatically within the browser, with no need to install anything. You can see it in action on [today's solution][my_day_11_solution] (**SPOILER ALERT** if you want to solve it yourself!). I'm not certain if the inputs for other users are different (I suspect they would be, to prevent cheating), but I've posted mine alongside each notebook so it can access them and produce the same results I get locally.

## Getting started in Jupyter

This project is actually my first foray into Jupyter notebooks of any kind. I'm accustomed to traditional coding, writing stuff into files and running things off terminals. The closest I came to anything that might have approximated a notebook in the past is using VS Code's [integrated terminals][vs_code_integrated_terminal], but that's not much different from having a code editor snapped to part of the screen with a PowerShell or Bash window open somewhere else.

Not to stray too far off the beaten path, I am using Jupyter within VS Code, as well, with the [Jupyter extension][jupyter_vscode_extension]. Works pretty well from my perspective, though the initial flash of JSON before the extension picks up the file on first startup can be slightly jarring.

As you can see browsing from [my Day 1 solution][my_day_01_solution] (**SPOILERS**, again) to more recent ones, I'm slowly getting more comfortable with Jupyter as a code runner and self-documentation format, which is pretty cool.

*But*, it does have its flaws, compared to the tooling I've been accustomed to up to now. Consider these personal gripes only.

- Searching for content within the notebook does not seem to use VS Code's search capabilities, instead requires some relearned keystrokes to use Jupyter's search function. Kind of quirky for my tastes.
- My other settings for newline creation, whitespace trimming, and others do not apply to the code in the notebook at all.
- Can't get [Black][black_docs] running inside there, though I knew that would be the case. I heard some work has been taking place to enable some Black equivalent running inside each cell of a notebook, but I haven't bothered looking further into that.
- A lot of other tooling I use for traditional Python projects aren't available in there, like MS's [Pylance][pylance_vscode_extension] language server, [flake8][flake8_docs], etc.

All that aside, I do enjoy using these notebooks for one-off projects, and I can see myself tapping into them to do some basic programming tutorials. Clearly if I was more into data science, I would be utilizing these with [numpy][numpy_docs] and some visualizations and what-have-you.

## Want more code challenges?

I know I don't, but you do you.

If you're interested in other code challenges, I recommend [Project Euler][project_euler], which I happened upon some years ago and got into for about 6 months before I had more work to do. :)

Similar setup to the Advent of Code: it presents a problem and asks for a solution. The problems are often difficult to figure out by brute-forcing, but by rearranging the elements using some mathematical properties, you can come to some pretty amazing solutions on your own. And once you solve it, a forum section opens up where folks have posted their methods to find the solution in various languages.

I do know other sites like [Codewars][codewars_link] exist with some more modern approaches to code challenges and katas to train on, but I have not personally used it or other code challenge sites, so I can't speak to it personally. If you like that better, hey, go for it.

Or just wait another 8 hours from the time of this post for [Advent of Code Day 12][advent_of_code_2020] to open up, am I right?
