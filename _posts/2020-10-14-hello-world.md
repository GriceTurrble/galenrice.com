Hi, folks. Galen here, aka GriceTurrble (or G.Rice, or just G).

Getting started here, not much content to add at the moment, but putting this out there so the site isn't so "templatey". Will probably remove this when I have a first *real* post to put up.

As for now:

```python
def get_started() -> str:
    return "Hello world!"

print(get_started())
```

Yeah, it's a developer blog. Another one. I'm sure you've had enough of those already.

## A *small* promise

I'll try not to waste your time in the stuff I write, even if I waste a lot of my own time in writing them. The point is to share an understanding of things, not to wax poetic about how good of a developer/writer/person I am (though I have my doubts on those).

More to come. See you around!
