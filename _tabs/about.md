My name is Galen Rice;
I live in Flemington, NJ, USA, with my lovely wife and two children;
and I write code sometimes.

I started off messing with PHP in college (everybody goes through that experimental phase)
then picked up [Python][python_org] and the [Django framework][django_project_page]
when faced with a problem at my former warehouse job back in 2014.
I've been developing software, for employers and for myself, ever since.

Over the years, I've picked up quite a few good coding habits, worked out some bad ones,
developed some software both professionally and personally,
started maintaining projects on GitHub, fell in love with some humans,
and learned all about the Oxford comma.

<!--
  And I've recently learned about semantic newlines
  (https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2012/one-sentence-per-line/),
  which is why this source document seems a bit stretched.
-->

## Projects

- [python-amazon-mws][gh_pam_main], a Python connector for Amazon MWS.
- Other things you might find in my [pinned repos on GitHub][gh_my_profile].
- Some personal sites hosted on Raspberry Pis at home, with tools for managing the home and family and recipes and whatnot.
- This site (_yo dawg_).

## Who is this site for?

Anybody who writes code or wants to write code, in Python or any language of their choosing;
anyone interested in general development topics, such as open source development
and Agile methodology (though I don't profess to be an expert in any sense);
or anyone who just wants to waste some time reading the ramblings of this person
who thinks they know enough to write about it. All are welcome here.

## Questions?

Send me an email or a Tweet or whatever the kids are doing these days
(_he said, being one of those "kids" himself, yet still somehow being behind the times_).
Check the links in the sidebar for details.
